1) Given function is poly2lsf:
Poly2lsf returns a vector lsf of line spectral frequencies (also known as line spectrum pairs) from a vector a of prediction filter coefficients.
first of all, we need to normalize if the highest order is not one.
the polynomials should have the roots inside the unit circle.
we need to create sum and difference filters. the first element is not used. we extract the length of P1 and Q1.
If order is even, we have to remove the known roots at z=1 for P1 and z=-1 for Q1. If odd, remove both the roots from P1. We extract the coefficent of P and Q and then find roots.we also find 2-quadrant and 4-quadrant inverse tangent and lastly sort them
eg)
Input:a=[1 .5 .2 .4 .3]
output:x =[0.9273 1.2838 2.0944 2.6532]

2) Given function is sinad:
sinad function returns the signal to noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) in dBc of the real-valued sinusoidal signal x.
In the time domain, SINAD is calculated as a ratio of the RMS value of the signal to the RMS value of the noise + distortion. 
RMS values are summed as squares and then the square root is taken of the result to obtain a composite RMS value.
SINAD=(Psignal+Pnoise+Pdistortion)/(Pnoise+Pdistortion)
SINAD is the ratio of the power of the fundamental (PS) to the power of all the other spectral components including noise (PN) and distortion (PD), but excluding dc.
This code is still in progess and will be updated soon.
